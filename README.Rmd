##Practical machine learning Project
This project is aimed to quantify how well people perform in an exercise.
We will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, who were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is [here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). Our goal is build a model from the [training data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv) to predict the manner in which they did the exercise in the [test data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv).
